    <description>[b]This pack depends on [url=]ReactionAPI[/url] in order to function, and cannot display reactions on it's own. Be sure to enable both![/b]

Reaction Port Pack is a package of well-known Reaction to Quality Items mods, but the quality detection system is powered by [b]ReactionAPI[/b], which improves on some issues found within the older mods.
