# Reaction Port Pack
Reaction Port Pack is both a collection of well-known "Reaction" to "Quality" Items mods and a modding API that allows modders to easily add Costumes, Music and Sounds to 5 types of reaction, referred to as Sets.

This mod can be easily installed by copying the contents of the repository into a folder within the 'mods' folder located in the same directory as the executable, or by subscribing to the mod on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3096196396).

### Documentation
Documentation is a WIP

In the mean time check out this [discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3096196396/4030221179843401670/) to know how to Add Packs.

### Note
The Github version does not include any of the Assets regularly packed within the Mod.
